            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Data for Black Lives</b> is a movement of activists, organizers, and mathematicians committed to the mission of using data science to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people. Since the advent of computing,
                big data and algorithms have penetrated virtually every aspect of our social and economic lives. These new data systems have tremendous potential to empower communities of color. Tools like statistical modeling, data visualization, and
                crowd-sourcing, in the right hands, are powerful instruments for fighting bias, building progressive movements, and promoting civic engagement.
            </p>
            <p>
                But history tells a different story, one in which data is too often wielded as an instrument of oppression, reinforcing inequality and perpetuating injustice. Redlining was a data-driven enterprise that resulted in the systematic exclusion of Black communities
                from key financial services. More recent trends like predictive policing, risk-based sentencing, and predatory lending are troubling variations on the same theme. Today, discrimination is a high-tech enterprise.
            </p>

She has worked since she was 17 behind the scenes as a movement builder, technologist and data scientist on a number of campaigns. She started Data for Black Lives because for too long she straddled the worlds of data and organizing and was determined to break down the silos to harness the power of data to make change in the lives of Black people. In two years, Data for Black Lives has raised over $3 million, hosted two sold out conferences at the MIT Media Lab and has changed the conversation around big data & technology across the US and globally. As the founder of Data for Black Lives, her work has received much acclaim. Yeshimabeit is an Echoing Green Black Male Achievement Fellow, an Ashoka Fellow and joins the founders of Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street in the distinguished inaugural class of Roddenberry Foundation Fellows. In 2020, Yeshimabeit was honored as a Forbes 30 under 30 social entrepreneur."

She is crafting a vision for the role of Data for Black Lives in the fields of machine learning, algorithmic fairness/accountability/recourse, artificial intelligence, etc. Jamelle is a scientist, researcher and visionary from a small town outside of St. Louis, MO. With her interdisciplinary research experiences, Jamelle focuses on empowering and centering those most marginalized in the mission to use data as protest, accountability and collective action. Her personal research interests involve utilizing techniques from optimization, network modeling, data science, algorithmic fairness and more. As a part of the five-year combined degree program, she graduated from Brown University with two degrees: a Bachelor of Science in physics and a Bachelor of Arts in Africana Studies. From initial conception to algorithmic deployment, Jamelle believes agency and power must be shifted from the hands of a few tech giants to the masses of people fighting for liberation."

She co-led a statewide coalition's legislative work in its fight for pretrial justice (bail, discovery, and speedy trial reforms) and led the ACLU affiliate in its opposition to the mandatory use of pretrial risk assessment tools. There, she sought to build on the work that exposes the categorically weak liberty interests and constitutional protections established for Black people and people of color and the importance of movement building. Prior to the NYCLU, she clerked for U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Bernice Donald and briefly worked as an associate at a law firm. Before law school, she worked for the U.S. House Judiciary Committee as its Communications Director, managing messaging on a wide range of civil rights issues including reparations, voting rights, and sentencing reform. She received both her BA with honors in Finance and her JD from Howard University."
